\chapter{Wind-driven debris}

\section{Introduction}

Classification of wind borne debris:
\begin{description}
\item[Compact debris: ]
whose three spatial dimensions are approximately the same
includes near-spherical objects such as gravel.
\item[Sheet/Plate debris: ]
with one of the spatial dimensions much smaller than the
other two includes roof tiles, roofing sheets and other cladding elements.
\item[Rod debris: ]
with one of the spatial dimensions much larger compared to the
other two includes objects such as timber pieces and bamboo rods.

Debris damage models and risk assessment models

\begin{enumerate}
\item The source and aerodynamic properties of the various debris types,
\item The debris flight behaviour, trajectory and impact velocities,
\item The damage resulting from debris impact.
\end{enumerate}
